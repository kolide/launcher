      # Getting this to work outside a normal build is quite
      # cumbersome. golangci/golangci-lint-action attempts to install
      # go, and use the module cache. In a way that _assumes_ no go
      # commands have been run in the workspace. But, this is
      # fundamentally incompatible with our needing to to generate
      # code before linting. Thus the various skip- commands.  See
