# Getting this to work outside a normal build is quite
# cumbersome. golangci/golangci-lint-action attempts to install go,
# and use the module cache. In a way that _assumes_ no go commands
# have been run in the workspace. But, this is fundamentally
# incompatible with our needing to to generate code before
# linting. Thus the various skip- commands.
