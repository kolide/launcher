Launcher Documentation
======================

Launcher is an open-source osquery execution environment that aims to make using and distributing osquery easier in environments where osquery is meant to communicate with a central management server. The main way to interact with the Launcher is via an executable binary called `launcher`. Launcher will launch, configure, and manage an osquery instance and manage communication to a server of your choosing. A tool called `package-builder` is also included. The `package-builder` aims to facilitate packaging the Launcher and Osquery.

### Using `launcher`

> For information on the `launcher` binary, building the code, connecting a Launcher instance to Fleet, etc. then see [the Launcher documentation](./launcher.md).

### Using `package-builder`

> If you're ready to package and distribute Launcher and Osquery, review the [documentation for the `package-builder` tool](./package-builder.md) that is provided with this repository.
