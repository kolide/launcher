# The Osquery Launcher

## Building the Code

Checkout this repository to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/kolide/launcher`. If you're new to Go and you don't know about `$GOPATH`, then check out the repo to `$HOME/go/src/github.com/kolide/launcher`. You will also need to install Go (1.9 or greater).

From the root of the repository, run the following:

```
make deps
make launcher
./build/launcher --help
```

Note that this style of build is generally only for development instances of Launcher. You should have `osqueryd` already installed on your system, as `launcher` will fall-back to looking for it in your `$PATH` in this case. For additional, more distributable, build options and commands, see the [Additional Build Options](#Additional Build Options) section.

For more distributable packages of Launcher and Osquery, consider using the [`package-builder`](./package-builder.md) tool that is provided with this repository.

## General Usage

To use The Launcher to easily connect osquery to a server that is compliant with the [gRPC specification](https://github.com/kolide/agent-api/blob/master/agent_api.proto), invoke the binary with just a few flags:

- `--hostname`: the hostname of the gRPC server for your environment
- `--root_directory`: the location of the local database, pidfiles, etc.
- `--enroll_secret`: the enroll secret that is used in your environment
- `--autoupdate`: a boolean flag which controls the osqueryd autoupdater (default: true)

```
./build/launcher \
  --hostname=fleet.acme.net:443 \
  --root_directory=/var/kolide-fleet \
  --enroll_secret=32IeN3QLgckHUmMD3iW40kyLdNJcGzP5
```

You can also define the enroll secret via a file path (`--enroll_secret_path`) or an environment variable (`KOLIDE_LAUNCHER_ENROLL_SECRET`). See `launcher --help` for more information.

You may need to define the `--insecure` and/or `--insecure_grpc` flag depending on your server configurations.

## Examples

### Connecting to Fleet

Let's say that you have [Kolide Fleet](https://github.com/kolide/fleet) running at https://fleet.acme.org, you could simply run the following to connect The Launcher to Fleet (assuming you replace the enroll secret with the correct string):

```
launcher \
  --enroll_secret=32IeN3QLgckHUmMD3iW40kyLdNJcGzP5 \
  --hostname=fleet.acme.org:443 \
  --root_directory=/var/acme/fleet
```

If you're running Fleet on the default development location (https://localhost:8080), you can connect a launcher via:

```
mkdir /tmp/fleet-launcher
launcher \
  --enroll_secret=32IeN3QLgckHUmMD3iW40kyLdNJcGzP5 \
  --hostname=fleet.acme.org:443 \
  --root_directory=/tmp/fleet-launcher \
  --insecure
```

Note the `--insecure` flag.

## Additional Build Options

### Normal development build

From the root of the repository, run the following:

```
make deps
make launcher
./build/launcher --help
```

### Cross-compiling binaries

To build macOS and Linux binaries, run the following:

```
make deps
make xp
```

Consider the following paths and file information:

```
$ file build/linux/launcher
build/linux/launcher: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, with debug_info, not stripped
$ file build/darwin/launcher
build/darwin/launcher: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
```

### Generating relocatable binary bundles

```
make deps
make binary-bundle
```

This will result in two files:

- `build/binary-bundle/launcher_0.4.0.zip`
- `build/binary-bundle/launcher_latest.zip`

Each zip will contain the following files:

```
|-- darwin
|   |-- launcher
|   |-- osquery-extension.ext
|   `-- osqueryd
`-- linux
    |-- launcher
    |-- osquery-extension.ext
    `-- osqueryd
```

### Installing the binaries for local usage

To install the launcher binaries to `$GOPATH/bin`, run the following:

```
make deps
make install
```

You *could* run `go get github.com/kolide/launcher/cmd/...` to install the binaries but it is not recommended because the binaries will not be built with version information when you run `launcher --version`.
