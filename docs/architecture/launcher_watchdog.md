### Watchdog Service

Note that for the initial implementation, this service is windows only. It is intentionally designed to give room for alternate OS implementations if needed in the future.
Most of the relevant code can be found in [ee/watchdog](../../ee/watchdog/)

Here is a basic sequence diagram displaying the enable path for the windows watchdog service. The `launcher_watchdog_enabled` control flag will trigger the initial configuration and installation, and removal of the flag will trigger removal of the service.

    participant LauncherKolideK2Svc
    Note right of LauncherKolideK2Svc: ./launcher.exe svc ...
    create participant WindowsServiceManager
    LauncherKolideK2Svc->>WindowsServiceManager: if launcher_watchdog_enabled
    create participant LauncherKolideWatchdogSvc
    WindowsServiceManager->>LauncherKolideWatchdogSvc: have we installed the watchdog?
    Note left of LauncherKolideWatchdogSvc: ./launcher.exe watchdog

    alt yes the service already exists
        LauncherKolideK2Svc->>LauncherKolideWatchdogSvc: Restart to ensure latest
    else no the service does not exist
        LauncherKolideK2Svc->>WindowsServiceManager: 1 - create, configure, etc
        LauncherKolideK2Svc->>LauncherKolideWatchdogSvc: 2 - Start
        activate LauncherKolideWatchdogSvc
    end

    loop every n minutes
        LauncherKolideWatchdogSvc->>WindowsServiceManager: Query LauncherKolideK2Svc status
        LauncherKolideWatchdogSvc->>LauncherKolideK2Svc: Start if Stopped
    end
```

The restart functionality is currently limited to detecting a stopped state, but the idea here is to lay out the foundation for more advanced healthchecking.
The watchdog service itself runs as a separate invocation of launcher, writing all logs to sqlite. The main invocation of launcher runs a watchdog controller, which responds to the `launcher_watchdog_enabled` flag, and publishes all sqlite logs to debug.json.
