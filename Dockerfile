# We need the launcher source to build launcher. We can get this one
# of three ways. git clone, copy, or mount. git clone was chosen, as
# it's the least bad.
# COPY is slow, and can pull in cruft from the working dir
# mount can pull in cruft from the working dir, and can pollute the working dir
# git clone ensures clean source
