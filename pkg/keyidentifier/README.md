# Keyidentifier

keyidentifier is a small go package designed to extract information
about encryption keys.

It's primary usage is to identify whether or not a key is
encrypted. But it additionally tries to return the key type and
size.

If there's interest, we can extract it from launcher and move it to
it's own repository.
