# Building Packages

## Building the tool

From the root of the repository, run the following:

```
make deps
make package-builder
./build/package-builder --help
```

## General Usage

### Creating a set of packages

Assuming you have built the `package-builder` tool and the `launcher` binaries via `make package-builder`, you can create a set of launcher packages by using the `package-builder make` command. The only required parameter is `--hostname`. If you don't define an enrollment secret via `--enroll_secret`, then a blank enrollment secret will be used when connecting to the gRPC server defined by the supplied hostname.

```
./build/package-builder make --hostname=grpc.launcher.acme.biz:443 --enroll_secret=foobar123
```

If you'd like to customize the keys that are used to sign the enrollment secret and macOS package, consider the following usage:

```
./build/package-builder make \
  --hostname=localhost:8082 \
  --enroll_secret=foobar123 \
  --osquery_version=stable \
  --mac_package_signing_key="Developer ID Installer: Acme Inc (ABCDEF123456)"
```

The macOS package will install a LaunchDaemon that will connect the launcher to the server specified by the `--hostname` flag, using an enrollment secret specified by the `--enroll_secret` flag. The Linux packages will currently lay down the launcher and osquery binaries as well as the enrollment secret specified by the `--enroll_secret` flag.

If you would like the resultant launcher binary to be invoked with the `--insecure` or `--insecure_grpc` flags, include them with the invocation of `package-builder`:

```
./build/package-builder make \
  --hostname=localhost:8082 \
  --enroll_secret=foobar123 \
  --insecure \
  --insecure_grpc
```

## Kolide Usage

### Authentication

You must be authenticated to Kolide's GCloud organization for the various `package-builder` commands to work. To do this, you will need to install the GCloud tools. Documentation on using and installing these tools can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/).

To authenticate to GCloud, use the following:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Development Packages

To use the tool to generate Kolide internal development packages, run:

```
./build/package-builder dev --debug \
  --mac_package_signing_key="Developer ID Installer: Acme Inc (ABCDEF123456)"
```

### Production Packages

To use the tool to generate Kolide production packages, run:

```
./build/package-builder prod --debug \
  --enroll_secret_signing_key=/path/to/key.pem \
  --mac_package_signing_key="Developer ID Installer: Acme Inc (ABCDEF123456)"
```
