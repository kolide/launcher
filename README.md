The Kolide Agent
================

The Kolide Agent (aka: Launcher) is the lightweight agent designed to work with [Kolide's service](https://www.kolide.com/).

It's built around osquery, but has several additional capabilities:
- secure automatic updates
- many additional tables
- device identification

### Documentation

Most of the documentation for how our agent works can be found online at https://www.kolide.com/docs/using-kolide/agent.

There is some additional, mostly legacy, documentation on GitHub in the
[`docs`](./docs/README.md) subdirectory of the repository.
